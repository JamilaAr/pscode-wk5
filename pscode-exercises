// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


//the answer of exercice 1
Display"enter number 1"
Input the first number from the user and store it in a variable called num1
int num1= 3;
Display"enter number 2"
Input the second number from the user and store it in variable called num2
int num2= 1;
Add the two numbers together and store the result in a variable called sum
Display "sum" ="num 1" + "num 2"
Console.WriteLine(num1+num2)
sum= 4



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
int sum=4;
if (4 % 2) ||(4==0){
    Console.Writeline(the number is even);
}
else{
  Console.WriteLine(the number is odd);  
}


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Display "enter num1"
Input the first number from the user and store it in a variable called num1
Display"enter num2"
Input the second number from the user and store it in a variable called num2
Display "enter num3"
Input the third number from the user and store it in a variable called num3
Display"enter num4"
Input the fourth number from the user and store it in a variable called num4
Display"enter num5"
Input the sixth number from the user and store it in a variable called num5


Total= num1+num2+num3+num4+num5
Average= total/5

min = num1
max = num1

 IF num2 < min THEN
        min = num2
    IF num3 < min THEN
        min = num3
    IF num4 < min THEN
        min = num4
    IF num5 < min THEN
        min = num5

    IF num2 > max THEN
        max = num2
    IF num3 > max THEN
        max = num3
    IF num4 > max THEN
        max = num4
    IF num5 > max THEN
        max = num5


    PRINT "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
    PRINT "The smallest number is: " + min
    PRINT "The largest number is: " + max
